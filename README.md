# Liri-2.0
This is the upgraded version of an Node Application I worked on in The UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I am very much interested in perfecting my skills as a MEAN/MERN Stack Developer, so I figured going back and upgrading the functionality on a simple Node application would be a great way to review the basic material. Still need to add Hangman functionality as well as messing with the callback functions.
